  target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">HTML was first created
  by Tim Berners-Lee</a>, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989.
  It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hypertext means that the document
  contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document
  or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how
text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
